PM2.5,Particulate Matter 2.5,"PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers. These tiny particles can penetrate deep into the lungs, posing significant health risks.","PM2.5 is caused by combustion from vehicles, industrial processes, power plants, residential wood burning, forest fires, agricultural burning, and some natural sources like dust storms.","PM2.5 can penetrate deeply into lungs, bloodstream, causing respiratory, cardiovascular diseases, aggravates asthma, reduces lung function, increases heart attack risks, and premature death."
PM10,Particulate Matter 10,"PM10 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less. These particles include dust, pollen, and mold, and can cause respiratory issues when inhaled.","PM10 is caused by construction sites, landfills, agriculture, roads, and natural sources like dust storms and wildfires. It includes larger particles than PM2.5, affecting respiratory health.","PM10 can causes eye, nose, throat irritation, exacerbates bronchitis, asthma, reduces lung function, raises respiratory infection, and cardiovascular disease risks."
SO2,Sulfur Dioxide,"SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide) is a colorless gas with a sharp, irritating odor. It's a significant environmental air pollutant, primarily produced by burning fossil fuels and volcanic activity.","SO2 emissions primarily come from the burning of fossil fuels by power plants and other industrial facilities, vehicle emissions, and natural sources like volcanic eruptions.","SO2 can  cause respiratory problems in humans, acid rain; impacts nature by damaging forests, aquatic ecosystems, and corroding buildings and monuments."
O3,Ozone,Ground-level ozone is caused by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight. Emissions from vehicles and industries are major contributors.,Ground-level ozone is caused by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight. Emissions from vehicles and industries are major contributors.,"Ground-level Ozone irritates human respiratory systems, reduces lung function; harms nature by damaging foliage, reducing crop yields, and affecting ecosystem health."
CO,Carbon Monoxide,"Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials, posing serious health risks by reducing blood's oxygen-carrying capacity.","CO is caused by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, industrial processes, residential heaters, and forest fires. Poor ventilation exacerbates exposure risks in enclosed spaces.","CO binds with hemoglobin, reducing oxygen delivery, causes headaches, dizziness, weakness, confusion, in high levels can be fatal, chronic exposure harms cardiovascular, neurological health."
NO2,Nitrogen Dioxide,"Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is a reddish-brown gas with a sharp, acrid odor, contributing to air pollution. It's involved in the formation of smog and acid rain, and affects respiratory health.","NO2 is primarily produced from the burning of fuels in vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities. It forms from reactions involving nitrogen oxides released during combustion processes.","NO2 worsens respiratory conditions in humans, contributes to ozone formation; affects nature by contributing to acid rain, damaging vegetation, and reducing biodiversity."
